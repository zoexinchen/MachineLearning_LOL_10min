# MachineLearning_LOL_10min
### Intro

In this project we acquired ranking data of leagur of legends from kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min)). The original data set contains up to 40 sections of data from almost 10,000 ranking games for the first 10 minutes, including how many kills red side or blue side got, the gold differences etc.. It also records the winning side of the game. 

Our work is to use machine learning methods to predict the winner of the game based on the data of the first 10 minutes.
